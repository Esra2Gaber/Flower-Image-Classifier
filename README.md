# Flower-Image-Classifier

The projectâ€™s main objective is to train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers based on some features. 
Three transfer learning approaches were used to reach the best accuracy.

## DataSet

The dataset used for training and testing consists of 102 flower categories; Each class consists of between 40 and 258 images.
The dataset is divided into a training set, a validation set, and a test set, The test set consists of the remaining 6149 images (minimum 20 per class), The test set and validation set consist of 10 images per class 

## Models

Three deep learning model were used to classify floer images into one of 102 categories which are mobilenet, Inception, and ResNet models.
